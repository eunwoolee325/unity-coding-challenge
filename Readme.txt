How did you decide on the approach you took?
I created 5 maps from the given images.
I put the images onto each game object spheres to create 360 map.
I placed left and right arrow images for navigating between the worlds that are in an infinite loop.
I put the GvrReiclePointer from GoogleVR onto the camera.
I put a transparent Fader in front of the camera, which becomes dark when GvrReticlePointer clicks the arrows, and the camera will move to next map at the same time. and also It works opposite side on same way.

Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Add a title menu/lobby scene
Appropriate music for each map
Sound effect during fading state
Add video maps instead of static image maps.

What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
I would solve the last functional Technic.
'When a user taps "previous" or "next" while the images are mid-transition, the current transition should be interrupted & reversed as necessary, as opposed to completing & starting a new transition.'
